Every time we instantiate a film from the schema, we want to have a new page generated.
So I think we should start by making the film schema and instancing it once.

Let's gather all films and create a new page for each.

ok, we didnt make a new page for each film yet but we set up the schema and instancing.
We don't need to dump in all the data to the cms yet.
Now, let's work on designing the film page template.
