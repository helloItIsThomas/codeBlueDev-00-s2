  Covering 71% of the Earth’s surface, the ocean is vast and unforgiving. But in order to uncover the knowledge needed to save our blue planet, we must go where humans have never dared and probe unexplored ocean depths. With this goal, WHOI scientists and engineers explore the earth’s final frontier, hoping to find solutions to our planet’s greatest challenges. 

  WHOI’s mantra states, “If there is no tool to do what needs to be done, we invent one; if there is no experimental method, we devise it. Because, now more than ever, the ocean matters to us all.” Code Blue is supporting WHOI’s newly created Room 71 Communications, headed up by Chasing Coral star Richard Veevers.
