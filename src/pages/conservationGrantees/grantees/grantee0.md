  Mission Blue is a global initiative of the Sylvia Earle Alliance, a 501c3 organization, which was formed in response to a wish Dr. Earle made upon winning the 2009 TED Prize. She implored humanity, “to use all means at your disposal — films, expeditions, the web, new submarines — to create a campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas; Hope Spots large enough to save and restore the blue heart of the planet.” Missionblue.org is an ocean community hub that embodies Sylvia’s wish to elevate public awareness about marine threats, and inspire support for impactful organizations, projects and scientific expeditions. Decades of overfishing, pollution and climate change have pushed the ocean to a breaking point—and threatened the very future of humanity.

  With over 165 Hope Spots around the world and 200+ partners in the Mission Blue Alliance, Mission Blue’s purpose to defend and explore the ocean is underway. Together, we are committed to inspiring a sea change in awareness and support for marine protected areas spanning ocean depths and sunlit reefs, from the high seas to the coastal mangroves that protect our cities.
